# Getting Remote Data Conclusion

---

## Conclusion

We've demonstrated that applications can give us access to remote data via APIs.

APIs give us selective access to the parts of a codebase developers want to
expose, which can make that codebase easier to work with.

We should now understand how APIs can be used, how to find an API endpoint, and
how to send a request for data to an API. With the ability to leverage remote
data in our applications, we can increase the functionality of our applications
and even save time!
